# Rectangle Algorithms for Nuvalence Interview
This project is a simple Gradle-based Java project that implements certain rectangle algorithms in order to demonstrate good programming practices and capabilities as part of my Nuvalence technical screen.


## Algorithms Implemented
Within the RectanglesUtilities utility class, there are the following algorithms implemented:



- **Rectangle Adjacency**
    - Rectangles are considered adjacent if they share at lease one portion of one side.

- **Rectangle Containment**
    - This algorithm will determine if one rectangle is wholly contained within another rectangle.

- **Rectangle Intersection**
    - Rectangles intersect when one or more intersecting lines occur.
