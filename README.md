# Rectangle Algorithms for Nuvalence Interview
This project is a simple Gradle-based Java project that implements certain rectangle algorithms in order to demonstrate good programming practices and capabilities as part of my Nuvalence technical screen.


## Algorithms Implemented
Within the RectanglesUtilities utility class, there are the following algorithms implemented:

- **Rectangle Adjacency**
    - Rectangles are considered adjacent if they share at lease one portion of one side: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br-wrght/nuvalence-exercise/master/docs/images/adjacency.png"><img alt="Image depicting adjacency in rectangles" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br-wrght/nuvalence-exercise/master/docs/images/adjacency.png" align="left" width="500" style="display:block"></a><br/>
- **Rectangle Containment**
    - This algorithm will determine if one rectangle is wholly contained within another rectangle: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br-wrght/nuvalence-exercise/master/docs/images/adjacency.png"><img alt="Image depicting adjacency in rectangles" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br-wrght/nuvalence-exercise/master/docs/images/adjacency.png" align="left" width="500"  style="display:block"></a><br/>
- **Rectangle Intersection**
    - Rectangles intersect when one or more intersecting lines occur: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br-wrght/nuvalence-exercise/master/docs/images/adjacency.png"><img alt="Image depicting adjacency in rectangles" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br-wrght/nuvalence-exercise/master/docs/images/adjacency.png" align="left" width="500"  style="display:block"></a><br/>
